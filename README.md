I've been trying for a while now to extract the WorldClim data on a easier way; 
I used to do it by using ArcMap, but most of the times my computer was unable to process
those WorldClim .tif images, but it's super easy to do it in R. However, 
the maps don't look as pretty as they would look on ArcMap, 
at least I haven't figured out a way to make them look pretty.
